# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you&CloseCurlyQuote;re seeing this, you&CloseCurlyQuote;ve probably already done this step. Congrats!

```shell
# create a new project in the current directory
bun create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
bun create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you&CloseCurlyQuote;ve created a project and installed dependencies with `bun install`, start a development server:

```shell
bun run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
bun run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```shell
bun run build
```

You can preview the production build with `bun run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
